        Abraham Lincoln is generally regarded as one of the greatest
        presidents of the U.S. His most famous speech was delivered
        in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, during the Civil War. This
        speech began with
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on
            this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
            dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
            that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
            can long endure."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Whatever one's opinion of Lincoln, no one can deny the
        enormous and lasting effect he had on the U.S.
